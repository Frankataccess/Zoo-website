Setup django and react 
Created Header 
Created home page 

14/01/2025 
created login backend 

20/01/2025 
attempted to remake the login and registration using axios. 
Currently not linking frontend to backend so login is unable to work

Spent ages checking new backend model for an error 
after narrowing it down the url allowed in my django settings was incorrect 
I am now currently working on a new navbar system that ive borrowed from material UI 

current version of backend is outdated 

Updated backend and sorted git stuff out

After a couple of redesigns i have decided to integrate the old navbar style with the new ones functionality 
This will allow users to access their account details more easily and allow for the navbar to be less clustered 
My aim for this week is to finish the frontend pages and get them looking good 
Then next week i will work on functional features like the hotel booking system and ticket system 
these tasks are currently beyond my knowledge of django to be completed

22/01/25
By using a prexisting logout feature i have managed to integrate it into my new navbar so users can logout.
The new navbar is very clean and minimalistic
The dropdown features now work and just need attatching to new pages.
I have added a folder called pages to clean up the file structure 
This required me to update a lot of the import paths 
By using the <Link to=""> tag and adding the urls in my app.jsx i was able to create a functioning navigation system
All of the necessary pages have been created 
My next steps 

Ticket system 
Hotel system 
rewards system 
Animal system 

The ticket system will require me to create a database 
It will combine user email, total tickets, the amounts of each ticket type, cost and the ticket ID 

The hotel system will also need a database 
It will store the user email, check in date, check out date, room ID and cost
I will also need to be able to make sure check in dates dont overlap 

Rewards system will take the total tickets the user has purchased and store them in a table 
Once the tickets are over a cretain number the user will be rewarded 

The animal system will impliment an API that returns information about the desired animal
