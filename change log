Setup django and react 
Created Header 
Created home page 

14/01/2025 
created login backend 

20/01/2025 
attempted to remake the login and registration using axios. 
Currently not linking frontend to backend so login is unable to work

Spent ages checking new backend model for an error 
after narrowing it down the url allowed in my django settings was incorrect 
I am now currently working on a new navbar system that ive borrowed from material UI 

current version of backend is outdated 

Updated backend and sorted git stuff out 

21/01/25
After a couple of redesigns i have decided to integrate the old navbar style with the new ones functionality 
This will allow users to access their account details more easily and allow for the navbar to be less clustered 
My aim for this week is to finish the frontend pages and get them looking good 
Then next week i will work on functional features like the hotel booking system and ticket system 
these tasks are currently beyond my knowledge of django to be completed
